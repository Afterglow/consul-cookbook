## What should I know before I get started?

### The Apache License
Bloomberg believes that licensing is very important to open source
projects. It helps ensure that software continues to be available
under the terms that the authors desired. Bloomberg uses the
[Apache 2.0 license][1] for its cookbooks.

This license strikes a balance between open contribution and allowing
you to use software however you like. The license tells you what
rights you have that are provided by the copyright holder.

1. Create a named feature branch (i.e. `add-new-provider`).
